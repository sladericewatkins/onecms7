This is the source code for SladeWatkins.com, it's largely what makes my website tick. I've open sourced it under the [MIT License](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/blob/master/LICENSE) for your benefit. (Do note that my blog is licensed under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.)

## About this site
I'm building this site to be database-free, no SQL of any kind to be found. I hate working with SQL (and maintaining those servers) and this is my attempt to stop doing so.

TL:DR: this simply requires a webserver with PHP 8+ installed, as well as minor support for Ruby and [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) (if hosting locally for development), and it DOESN'T REQUIRE SQL/Database servers of any kind. Yay!

## Find an issue?
If you find an issue, patch it up and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/pulls)! I'll take a look at it and might merge it in.

## Report security issues (live site)
Though, for security issues relating to the server I use on sladewatkins.com directly, I ask you reach out privately.
