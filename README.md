This is the source code for SladeWatkins.com, it's largely what makes my website tick.

## About this site
I'm building this site to be database-free, no SQL of any kind to be found. I hate working with SQL (and maintaining those servers) and this is my attempt to stop doing so.

TL:DR: this simply requires a webserver, as well as support for Ruby and [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) (if hosting locally for development), and it DOESN'T REQUIRE SQL/Database servers of any kind. Yay!

## Find an issue?
If you find an issue, you might be able to patch it up yourself! Check out [the guide](https://www.sladewatkins.com/docs/website/) to see how you can help. When you've put together your changes, submit them as a [pull request](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/pulls) directed to the [``staging``](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/tree/staging) branch! I'll take a look at it and might merge it in. (Note: all PRs sent to the ``master`` branch won't be considered. Commits must target ``staging``, see [the documentation here](https://www.sladewatkins.com/docs/website/how-staging-works/) for more details.)

If you'd prefer to just report it, please do so using the [issues tab](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/issues).

## Report security issues (live site)
Though, for security issues relating to the server I use on sladewatkins.com directly, I ask you reach out privately.
