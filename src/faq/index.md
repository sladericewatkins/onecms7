## 📌 What are your vacation dates for December 2022-January 2023?
Each year around the holidays, I take a break from answering emails or working on projects. This year is no different. I'll be off from December 21, 2022 through January 2nd, 2023. "Business as usual" will resume January 3rd, 2023. **I wish you a very Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!** ❤️

## Can you develop my app?
Sorry, but unfortunately, I'm many years removed from the mobile app development scene. **I do mess around with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), but that's more as a hobby, and I'm by no means experienced.** I have to regularly ask others for guidance just to figure out the interface. 

Nowadays, I'm focused on web and computer software and I'm content with that.

## Will you ever return to mobile app development?
Yes, it's on my list of things I'd like to do! Perhaps it'll become my full-time "actual" job? I feel a calling there.

## What text editor do you prefer most?
[TextMate](https://macromates.com/) on Mac, [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) on everything else. Both are open source!

## What operating system(s) do you prefer most?
[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) and [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com). I'm not a fan of the direction Windows is going in, but keep it around for some development stuff.

## Where are the archives of your website's previous iterations?
Each version from v4 ("oldsite") and newer has been archived, you can find them in their new homes below:
- [v4](https://www.oldsite.sladewatkins.com)
- [v5](https://vault.sladewatkins.com/v5/)

## What phone do you daily drive?
I daily drive both an [iPhone SE (2nd generation)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP820?locale=en_US) *and* [Google Pixel 6](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_6-11037.php), both connected to [US Mobile](https://www.usmobile.com) (Verizon SIM/Warp 5G). I switch which one is in "lead" (read: "has my personal SIM card in it") pretty frequently. It's a bad habit, I know... but hey, it is what it is.

## Is ‘Dear Nintendo’ still being maintained?
Yes, it is still available at [dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com](https://dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com). Folks can sign the open letter until March 2023, at which point, it will be [sent to the vault](https://vault.sladewatkins.com).

## Is it true that you spoke to New York State lawmakers in 2021?
As part of "Lobby Day" at my former high school, I spoke to several lawmakers in New York State, including [my senator](https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/daphne-jordan), about my experience in BOCES programs over the years. Part of that included advocating for the continuation of funding for my former school.

## What are you up to nowadays?
Well, I work on [Kakariko Herald](https://www.kakarikoherald.com) full-time, which I juggle with some other secret projects! I love what I do and wouldn’t change it for the world. If you’d like to support me, you can find me over on KH or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sladewatkins)!
