## What operating system do you prefer most?
macOS.

## Is ‘Dear Nintendo’ still being maintained?
Yes, it is still available at [dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com](https://dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com). Folks can sign the open letter until March 2023, at which point, it will be [sent to the vault](https://vault.sladewatkins.com).

## Is it true that you spoke to New York State lawmakers in 2021?
As part of Lobby Day, I spoke to several lawmakers in New York State, including [my senator](https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/daphne-jordan), about my experience in BOCES programs over the years. Part of that included advocating for the continuation of funding for my former school.

## Is it true you work with (insert name here)?
The only affiliation I publicly have is with the [Wallymer group](https://www.wallymer.com). My friends and I work on projects under that name with help and guidance from some of our mentors.

## What phone do you daily drive?
I daily drive both an iPhone SE (2nd generation) *and* Google Pixel 6, both connected to [US Mobile](https://www.usmobile.com) (Verizon). I switch which one is in "lead" (read: "has my personal SIM card in it") pretty frequently. It's a bad habit, I know... but hey, it is what it is.

## What are you up to nowadays?
Well, I work on [Kakariko Herald](https://www.kakarikoherald.com) full-time, which I juggle with some other secret projects! I love what I do and wouldn’t change it for the world. If you’d like to support me, you can find me over on KH!
