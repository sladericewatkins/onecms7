## What text editor do you prefer most?
[TextMate](https://macromates.com/) on Mac, [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) on everything else. Both are open source!

## What operating system(s) do you prefer most?
[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) and [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com). Not a fan of the direction Windows is going in, but keep it around for some development stuff.

## Where are the archives of your website's previous iterations?
Each version from v4 and newer has been archived, you can find them in their new homes below:
- [v4](https://www.oldsite.sladewatkins.com)
- [v5](https://vault.sladewatkins.com/v5/)

## What phone do you daily drive?
I daily drive both an [iPhone SE (2nd generation)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP820?locale=en_US) *and* [Google Pixel 6](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_6-11037.php), both connected to [US Mobile](https://www.usmobile.com) (Verizon SIM/Warp 5G). I switch which one is in "lead" (read: "has my personal SIM card in it") pretty frequently. It's a bad habit, I know... but hey, it is what it is.

## Is ‘Dear Nintendo’ still being maintained?
Yes, it is still available at [dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com](https://dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com). Folks can sign the open letter until March 2023, at which point, it will be [sent to the vault](https://vault.sladewatkins.com).

## Is it true that you spoke to New York State lawmakers in 2021?
As part of "Lobby Day" at my former high school, I spoke to several lawmakers in New York State, including [my senator](https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/daphne-jordan), about my experience in BOCES programs over the years. Part of that included advocating for the continuation of funding for my former school.

## What are you up to nowadays?
Well, I work on [Kakariko Herald](https://www.kakarikoherald.com) full-time, which I juggle with some other secret projects! I love what I do and wouldn’t change it for the world. If you’d like to support me, you can find me over on KH or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sladewatkins)!
