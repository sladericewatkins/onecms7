## Before you reach out
Please double check [this list](/links) to make sure the account in question is **NOT** on it! *If it is, then it's legitimate, and you don't have to reach out.*

## Get in touch
Please email [foundafake@sladewatkins.net](mailto:foundafake@sladewatkins.net) with the details. Also include whether or not you've already reported the account (and any relevant case numbers, if applicable) as that helps my team!
