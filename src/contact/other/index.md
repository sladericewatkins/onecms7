In light of the holidays, I am stepping (mostly) away from my inbox until January 3rd, 2023. Replies to emails will be sporadic. Thanks for understanding!

Was what you want to talk to me about not on [the list](/contact/)? No worries, you can contact me directly.

## But first...
Here's a list of everything I'm *already getting emails about*, just to save us both time.
- I'm aware that Twitter is doing... many questionable things under Elon Musk's ownership [and I wrote a Blo(n)g(er) post that kind of mentions it](/blonger/i-think-i-am-done-with-twitter-for-now/). **I'm not really interested in any further developments, honestly.**
- I'm aware that there have been email delivery problems with **sladewatkins.net** lately, but they should be fixed now.

## Still interested?
Send an email to [slade@sladewatkins.com](mailto:slade@sladewatkins.com) and I might get back to you. I get a lot of emails, but you should get a response within a day or two.
