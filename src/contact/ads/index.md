title: Ads and Sponsorships
---

Got an opportunity for me? I'd love to hear about it!

## But first, note...
- I can't accept paid advertising or sponsorships from games or apps that include in-app purchases of $99.99 USD or more. *Less than that, however, is fine.*
- I can't accept paid advertising or sponsorships from games or apps that include gambling. *It's a legal thing, sorry.*
- I can't accept paid advertising or sponsorships from games that are available on Nintendo Switch. *It's an [ethical thing](https://www.kakarikoherald.com/pages/6-ethics-policy), sorry.*
- I can't accept paid advertising or sponsorships that are pay-per-click, pay-per-view, pay-per-download, etc. *Flat rates only, please.*
- I wrote a Blo(n)g(er) post on how I approach ads and sponsorships, which [I recommend you read](/blonger/and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor/).
