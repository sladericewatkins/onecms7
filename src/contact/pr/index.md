Thanks for your interest!

## Kakariko Herald
Got a press release about something Nintendo-related? Send it to me at [watkins@kakarikoherald.com](mailto:watkins@kakarikoherald.com), and I'll relay it to the team. If you need to reach out to Kakariko Herald for any other reason, you should see [the contact page](https://www.kakarikoherald.com/pages/8-contact) for more details.

## Outside of that
Please don't send PR stuff to my personal inbox. I'll mark it as spam if it's unsolicited (aka, not specific to something that Kakariko Herald reports on). I know that's harsh, but I deal with *a lot* of emails and it just saves everyone time.
