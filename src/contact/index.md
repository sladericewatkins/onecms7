## Uh, before you keep reading...
Just wanted to give you a note that *I'm now (mostly) away from my inbox until January 3rd, 2022*. (Replies to family and friends won't be affected, but I won't be answering most emails that come through from folks.) 

Each year around the holidays, I take some time off to go spend with family and friends, and this year is no exception! 2022 has been a whirlwind of chaos and I'm happy it's coming to a close on such a high note.

That said, **my team and I wish you a very Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!** 

Stay safe!  
-- Slade
