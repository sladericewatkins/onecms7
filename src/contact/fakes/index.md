title: Report a fake account
---

Found an account you think is fake? Please tell my team about it.

## But first, note...
You should double check [this list](https://www.sladewatkins.com/links) to make sure the account in question is **NOT** on it! *If it is, then it's legitimate, and you don't have to reach out.*

## Get in touch
Please email [teamslade-fakes@sladewatkinsmedia.com](mailto:teamslade-fakes@sladewatkinsmedia.com) with the details. Also include whether or not you've already reported the account (and any relevant case numbers, if applicable) as that helps my team!
