It’s an interesting question to think about. Every year in the ‘20s has had its own “year of” theme…
- **2020**: Year of The Pandemic
- **2021**: Year of The Pandemic: Season Two, Electric Boogaloo.
- **2022**: Year of The Pandemic: Season Three, now with Absolute Chaos mixed in

So what will 2023 bring?

For me, I hope it brings that special someone closer to me. I hope it brings happiness and prosperity to myself, and especially the people around me. I hope it brings more quality time with family and friends, most of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic began. And I hope it brings success: for every project I work on and release this coming year.

2022 wasn’t easy by any means. There’s a lot of moving parts that made it so overwhelming and insane. But it’s over now — 2023 has the opportunity to be (and will be) different. Full stop.

So 2023 will the **year of love, happiness, success, and change.** I’m calling it now.
