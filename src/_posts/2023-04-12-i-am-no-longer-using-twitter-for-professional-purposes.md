Today, I'm making the decision to **no longer use Twitter for professional purposes**. This means I will not advertise projects or other works on my personal Twitter handle going forward.

I will continue to use it, however, to connect with friends and mutual follows until the site [inevitably dies](https://twitter.com/TheMcKenziest/status/1645949598429757447). However, my posts will be unprofessional at best and I will basically only post memes and random stuff I come up with. *It goes without saying -- but as a reminder -- my posts on any social media platform are my own thoughts and opinions, they do NOT represent any company I am affiliated with.*

I can be found in [many other places](https://www.sladewatkins.com/links), as well as on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@sladewatkins). 

Thank you for your support! Let's ride that bird site out into the sunset...
