Well, everyone, it's official: I've left tech.lgbt, and have moved elsewhere. 

Why? Well, my friends and I are now hosting [our own instance](https://pope.party) of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), which has already begun communicating with the rest of the fediverse. I am, of course, the admin as becomes custom with anything that requires work to make happen. (*Sigh.*)

The name, **pope.party**, is actually part of an *inside joke* I had with my friends. To explain that for you: one of my closest friends, Colin, frequently uses a Google Translate language pack within Minecraft that changes the "lava plops" subtitle to "benefits of the pope" ...and thus, the name was born!

You can find me [@slade@pope.party](https://pope.party/@slade), and you can read our [announcement for Kakariko Herald here](https://www.kakarikoherald.com/site-news/3753-kakariko-herald-goes-all-in-on-fediverse-where-to-find-us), too.

*P.S. Yes, I'm aware Facebook/Meta is blocking the pope.party domain for spam. I am working on getting it fixed.*
