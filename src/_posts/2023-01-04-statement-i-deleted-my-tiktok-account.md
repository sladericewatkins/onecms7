Tonight, I deleted my TikTok account. **It no longer exists.**

I admit, I was skeptical at first when all the claims of its security first came out, but semi-recent developments have PROVEN that  it is a privacy and security risk. 

I urge others to completely delete their accounts and remove the app from their phones as soon as possible. It is not safe to use.

On to the next chapter, somewhere that isn't a risk to privacy, security, and safety.

Thanks for watching.
