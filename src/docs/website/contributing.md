My website is [**open source**](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website), meaning anyone can contribute code as they see fit, or even fork it and use it for their own purposes (within the scope that [the license](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/blob/master/LICENSE) permits).

I ask that all pull requests and issues be directed towards the repository and *not* my email, **unless** the issue pertains to a major security risk.
