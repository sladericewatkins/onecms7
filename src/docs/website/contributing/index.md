My website is [**open source**](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website), meaning anyone can contribute code as they see fit, or even fork it and use it for their own purposes (within the scope that [the licenses](https://www.sladewatkins.com/legal/licenses/) permit).

Since it can sometimes get lost amongst the chaos, I would to remind everyone that all Pull Requests (PRs) and issues should be directed towards the repository on the ``staging`` branch, and *not* my email, **UNLESS** the issue pertains to a major security risk. Also, please make sure to [test your revisions](https://www.sladewatkins.com/docs/website/revision-testing/) before submitting a PR.

## Submitting a pull request
You can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/pulls) to the GitHub repository. Friendly reminder to make sure you don't select ``master`` as the branch you want to merge into: that's not allowed. Please, always make sure to select ``staging`` when submitting a PR. 

I will then take the commits, merge them into my ``staging`` tree, then send them up to ``master`` once I've tested and reviewed revisions myself.
