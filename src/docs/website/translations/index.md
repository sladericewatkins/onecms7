title: Website - Translations

## The main concern
The main concern right now is that the way the site is structured prevents me from making translations possible. I'd have to rework the entire site. There exists [documentation](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/internationalization#setup--translations) for how to get translations up and running with *Bridgetown*, so that'd be what is used as a base. 

## How can you help
If you'd like to help, you can fork the repository and start pulling it apart. Translate the pages, documentation, etc., and send them up to ``staging`` as a pull request. 

## Translations I'm looking for

Using the aforementioned [Bridgetown documentation](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/internationalization#setup--translations), I'm interested in getting this website translated in the following languages:

- Spanish (es)
- Japanese (ja-JP)

But any language, frankly, would be great! (Since English is the primary language of the site owner (me), I've marked en-US as indefinitely complete.)
