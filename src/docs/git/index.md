Contributing to a Git repository of mine? Here's what you need to know:
1. You need to add your [``Signed-off-by:``](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14044024) to every commit (with the **one and ONLY** exception being reverts)
2. I reserve the right to deny or otherwise ignore pull requests for whatever reason (including forgetfulness).
3. If submitting via email, please direct your patches and pull requests to [srw@sladewatkins.net](mailto:srw@sladewatkins.net). This is my email for git-related operations and is what I use to sign-off all commits to my repos.

## Mailmap
Should you change your email address at any time, we ask that you add it to the [.mailmap file](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website/blob/staging/.mailmap) on ``staging`` so that our Git clients are up-to-date.
