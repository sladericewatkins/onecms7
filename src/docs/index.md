Welcome to the Documentation microsite. This microsite contains documentation for many of the projects I'm working on, including some that are open source. 

## What's here
You can select a project from the list below to see its documentation.
- [Git](/docs/git/) - The documentation for how you should use ``git`` to contribute to my repositories.
- [Website](/docs/website/) - The documentation for this website and the engine behind it *OneCMS*, which is based on *[Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown)*.
