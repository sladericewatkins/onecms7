title: macOS 13 Ventura Issues
---

Since I've been using macOS Ventura, I've run into quite a few problems that I figured it'd be best to document on my website and see if anyone else had any they'd like to add.

If you've run into an issue not listed here, please email me directly at [slade@sladewatkins.com](mailto:slade@sladewatkins.com) or [submit a pull request](https://www.sladewatkins.com/docs/website/contributing/). (If you're emailing me for *any other reason*, please [go here](https://www.sladewatkins.com/contact/) first.)

## Encountered
These are arranged by application or function, and were encountered on a [2022 M2 MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP870?locale=en_US) running macOS (13.1) Ventura.

###  System Settings
*__Author's note__: System Preferences was already bad, but it was stable. This is worse.*

- System Settings is unreliable, as it locks up and crashes frequently.
- System Settings doesn't display available updates, despite them being available.
- Constant notifications regarding "new login items" despite nothing on my system actually changing.
- Settings that were once easily accessible in the previous System Preferences are now gone, or harder to access, in the new System Settings app.
- Searching for something doesn't work 95% of the time.

### Mail
*__Author's note__: Yes, I prefer macOS Mail, has never done anything wrong... except...*

- Slow and unreliable at times, especially when moving a bulk amount of messages to another Mailbox or the Trash.
- Sometimes it gets stuck downloading new messages and requires a restart.
- Freezes when reading emails from other Mailboxes other than the Inbox.

## Resolved
### In macOS 13.1 Ventura
- [13.1] Network Locations has returned. ([Source](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/12/13/macos-13-1/))
