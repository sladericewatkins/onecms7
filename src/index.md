# Hi, [I'm Slade](/about/)!

Iâ€™m a writer, [journalist](https://www.kakarikoherald.com/author/slade-watkins), developer, web designer, and content creator. This is my website: my corner of the internet to show off [some of the things I'm thinking about](https://www.sladewatkins.com/blog/) or [happen to be up to](https://www.sladewatkins.com/sitemap/). I'm also on the *de facto* primary [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@sladewatkins) Mastodon instance, as well as in [other places](https://linktr.ee/sladewatkins) on the web.
