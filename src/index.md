# Hi, [I'm Slade](/about).

Iâ€™m a developer, web designer, and content creator. Oh, and this is my website: my corner of the internet to show off [some of the things I'm up to](/blonger). 

But if you're looking for **Slade Watkins Media**, you can find it [here](https://media.sites.sladewatkins.com).

## Open Source
I've made my website open source. If you find a typo, have suggestions for additions, or whatever the case may be - you can contribute it to the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sladewatkins/website) as a pull request *or* report it as an issue.
