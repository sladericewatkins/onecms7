In summary: **please do not make subreddits, Reddit user accounts, or anything of the sort in my name.** Regardless of whatever you claim (it's "unofficial," "parody," etc.) ***I will reach out to Reddit and have them shut down, or even take legal action if necessary.*** Thank you for your understanding, full explanation is below.

I do not run an **official, public** subreddit on Reddit. I do use Reddit: I hold [r/sladewatkins](https://www.reddit.com/r/sladewatkins) and [u/sladewatkins](https://www.reddit.com/u/sladewatkins) under my control and use [u/sladeiam](https://www.reddit.com/u/sladeiam) for official communications over there. The fact is, **I'm uncomfortable having an open forum on the internet dedicated solely to me.** A subreddit is, in every sense, exactly that — and it sounds like *a recipe for disaster*, especially if I were to endorse it.

And that's not even beginning to mention what Reddit is home to, or has been home to previously — *conspiracy theorists, misogynists, racist and xenophobic people, etc.* — I'd very much **rather not having a section dedicated to me on that hellsite no matter how strong the moderation is set**. That's not an indirect or unofficial endorsement I want to make. I literally wince at the very idea of it. **I do not want part of it.**

You're probably wondering why I have a Reddit account then... well, for one, it's for official business purposes and two, I've filtered my feed **heavily**. I've mostly stayed away from the trash for years now. But regardless, I don't want part of it in any further capacity than "I happen to look at adorable Animal Crossing content on occasion" or whatever the case may be. I hope you can understand.

This page is here so that if you Google my name with "Reddit" or "subreddit", it comes up. **Please do not set up any subreddits, accounts, or whatever else in my name.** This includes unofficial subreddits and/or accounts, parody subreddits and/or accounts, or whatever I might be forgetting to list here. **Just don't.** ***I will not hesitate to take action, through Reddit Support or legal action, if applicable.*** Thanks!
