I found this in my notes app tonight.

*when will my scandal be? who will my scandal be? is the world just ready, and waiting to take me down?*

The note's dated April 23, 2019. Who knows what younger Slade was thinking when he wrote this. One thing's for sure, 2023 Slade doesn't remember, but his best guess is that younger Slade was just dumping everything on his mind into one document. 

That's his best guess, anyway.
