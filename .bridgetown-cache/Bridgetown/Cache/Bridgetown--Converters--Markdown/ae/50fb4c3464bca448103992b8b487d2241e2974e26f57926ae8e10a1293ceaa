I":<p>I’ve got feelings about accepting sponsorships. And since it’s the holiday season, I wanted to share how I determine whether or not to take a sponsorship, or join an affiliate program, as those emails are starting to hit my inbox now…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Do your due diligence.</strong> I cannot stress this one enough: A company is <a href="https://twitter.com/itsechomusic_/status/1572047690069843968">not all they seem to be</a>, so do your research and make an informed decision based on the information you find. <em>Google, review sites, and similar are your best friends: use them.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Know your worth.</strong> If a company won’t at least negotiate (read: compromise) for a fair price, it’s best to walk away. I’ve done it many times that I’ve lost count. <em>If only you knew how much I’ve left on the table…</em></li>
  <li><strong>If it seems sketchy, it probably is.</strong> Trust your gut. If it seems off in any way, don’t accept it. No, really.</li>
  <li><strong>Fair, flat rates only.</strong> Don’t do anything that relies on clicks or views for payment. That’s not an ad, that’s an affiliate scheme. Those are basically scams in 2022… run away.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, none of that is to say you <em>can’t</em> join an affiliate program. But you shouldn’t be asked in the guise of “this is a sponsorship.” In my opinion, if you’re joining an affiliate program, it’s something <em>you</em> decide and aren’t coerced into, something <em>you</em> believe in and not told to believe in. Working like this since 2019 has only given me the strength to take on sponsorships, or join the affiliate programs of things I care about. Everyone deserves that freedom.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps someone. That’s the idea. Let me know if you have any questions, though.</p>
