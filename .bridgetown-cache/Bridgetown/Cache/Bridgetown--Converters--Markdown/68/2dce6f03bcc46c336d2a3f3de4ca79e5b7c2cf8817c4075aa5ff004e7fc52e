I"n<p>I got to thinking… I’m an indecisive mess.</p>

<p>I don’t know what type of phone I want to use – dumb phone, smart phone, Android phone, iOS phone – I don’t know what operating system I want to use. I’ve used probably every type of device, and while I do have preferences, I almost never stick with anything for more than a couple weeks. That annoys people, I get it, but I like to try everything. And sometimes I find new things that fit into the workflow.</p>

<p>This sort of thing annoys my brain too. I feel conflicted about <em>everything</em>. That’s not great for me, because all of a sudden – in the middle of the day – I’ll just decide to switch a SIM card to a different phone or reinstall the OS on my computer.</p>

<p>Is it fun? Yes.</p>

<p>Is it, at the same exact time, stressful? Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Will I keep doing it? Probably.</p>
