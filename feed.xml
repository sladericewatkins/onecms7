&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, my friends and I are now hosting &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party&quot;&gt;our own instance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, which has already begun communicating with the rest of the fediverse. I am, of course, the admin as becomes custom with anything that requires work to make happen. (&lt;em&gt;Sigh.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name, &lt;strong&gt;pope.party&lt;/strong&gt;, is actually part of an &lt;em&gt;inside joke&lt;/em&gt; I had with my friends. To explain that for you: one of my closest friends, Colin, frequently uses a Google Translate language pack within Minecraft that changes the “lava plops” subtitle to “benefits of the pope” …and thus, the name was born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find me &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party/@slade&quot;&gt;@slade@pope.party&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kakarikoherald.com/site-news/3753-kakariko-herald-goes-all-in-on-fediverse-where-to-find-us&quot;&gt;announcement for Kakariko Herald here&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. Yes, I’m aware Facebook/Meta is blocking the pope.party domain for spam. I am working on getting it fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Why open source matters &amp;amp; how I’m helping</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/why-open-source-matters-and-how-i-am-helping/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why open source matters &amp; how I&apos;m helping" /><published>2022-12-13T07:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-13T07:45:00-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-12-13-why-open-source-matters-and-how-i-am-helping.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/why-open-source-matters-and-how-i-am-helping/">&lt;p&gt;(Updated December 13th, 2022)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Twitter’s acquisition by Elon Musk, and the clear indication that Big Tech was only going to get bigger, I previously announced via social media that I’d commit to using open-source software and technologies on my devices going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reigns true with me taking a moment to reiterate the announcement, as well as detail the specifics of what I’ve changed thus far (as of November 4, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, here was my full statement on it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m making a commitment to [heavily] use open-source software in my workflow starting in 2023. Until that time, I will slowly phase out [most] proprietary software on my systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The only exception will be if it’s needed for work. Otherwise, an open-source alternative will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m sick of enabling corporate overlords and billionaires, and will not allow them to exert control over how I operate on a day-to-day. This mission has already begun with my switch back to Linux, this time using the Ubuntu-based Pop!_OS*.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where I am able, I will give back to these open-source projects monetarily, time-wise (helping with PRs, issues, development), or both. I am a firm believer in open-source: it is the future. Life’s better when we all work together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s what I’ve changed so far…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will no longer use Windows unless it is absolutely required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I use Linux for computing devices, Android on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve switched from Adobe Creative Cloud to DaVinci Resolve and GIMP on my primary system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to update this article as I continue changing my workflow over to open source alternatives. I expect to be fully switched over to mostly open-source projects by February 6, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to hit me up and ask questions about it! I usually hang out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.lgbt/@sladewatkins&quot;&gt;Mastodon (@sladewatkins@tech.lgbt)&lt;/a&gt;, but I can also be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.slade.link&quot;&gt;everywhere else&lt;/a&gt; too (including &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">I’m an indecisive mess</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-am-an-indecisive-mess/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I&apos;m an indecisive mess" /><published>2022-12-03T00:58:36-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-03T00:58:36-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-12-03-i-am-an-indecisive-mess.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-am-an-indecisive-mess/">&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking… I’m an indecisive mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what type of phone I want to use – dumb phone, smart phone, Android phone, iOS phone – I don’t know what operating system I want to use. I’ve used probably every type of device, and while I do have preferences, I almost never stick with anything for more than a couple weeks. That annoys people, I get it, but I like to try everything. And sometimes I find new things that fit into the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing annoys my brain too. I feel conflicted about &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. That’s not great for me, because all of a sudden – in the middle of the day – I’ll just decide to switch a SIM card to a different phone or reinstall the OS on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it fun? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it, at the same exact time, stressful? Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I keep doing it? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">And now, a word from our sponsor</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="And now, a word from our sponsor" /><published>2022-11-30T21:20:57-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-30T21:20:57-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-11-30-and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor/">&lt;p&gt;I’ve got feelings about accepting sponsorships. And since it’s the holiday season, I wanted to share how I determine whether or not to take a sponsorship, or join an affiliate program, as those emails are starting to hit my inbox now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your due diligence.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot stress this one enough: A company is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/itsechomusic_/status/1572047690069843968&quot;&gt;not all they seem to be&lt;/a&gt;, so do your research and make an informed decision based on the information you find. &lt;em&gt;Google, review sites, and similar are your best friends: use them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your worth.&lt;/strong&gt; If a company won’t at least negotiate (read: compromise) for a fair price, it’s best to walk away. I’ve done it many times that I’ve lost count. &lt;em&gt;If only you knew how much I’ve left on the table…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it seems sketchy, it probably is.&lt;/strong&gt; Trust your gut. If it seems off in any way, don’t accept it. No, really.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair, flat rates only.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t do anything that relies on clicks or views for payment. That’s not an ad, that’s an affiliate scheme. Those are basically scams in 2022… run away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, none of that is to say you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; join an affiliate program. But you shouldn’t be asked in the guise of “this is a sponsorship.” In my opinion, if you’re joining an affiliate program, it’s something &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; decide and aren’t coerced into, something &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; believe in and not told to believe in. Working like this since 2019 has only given me the strength to take on sponsorships, or join the affiliate programs of things I care about. Everyone deserves that freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post helps someone. That’s the idea. Let me know if you have any questions, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">The AT&amp;amp;T Saga</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/the-att-saga/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The AT&amp;T Saga" /><published>2022-11-22T23:22:44-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T23:22:44-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-11-22-the-att-saga.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/the-att-saga/">&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I should explain &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1594799892148662272&quot;&gt;what on Earth happened&lt;/a&gt; to make me finally switch from the carrier that I’ve defended endlessly for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; now. &lt;strong&gt;Because my recommendations to family and friends regarding cell phone services are about to change because of the experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For context&lt;/strong&gt;: Prior to when the story begins, I had multiple issues where my phone(s) would randomly stop detecting the AT&amp;amp;T network, and I would need to call to get my SIM provisioned. That happened three separate times. Keep this in mind as you read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July this past year (2022), I got a new phone that had 5G capabilities. I didn’t have a phone plan that could use it – I was grandfathered in – nor did I have a 5G-capable SIM card anyways, so I just decided to forgo it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may’ve been a mistake, as around a week later, my SIM card died. I immediately contacted AT&amp;amp;T Support for assistance wherein they essentially told me if I did not upgrade my &lt;em&gt;grandfathered&lt;/em&gt; phone plan, they would not issue a SIM. In other words… I got the run-around: how lovely! Frustrated, I disconnected with them and went to go speak with my father. My parents upgraded my phone plan to the highest one, the one with 5G, and after a couple minutes – it was fine! …For a little more than 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s August, and I’ve completely lost service again. At this point, I’ve been without it I asked my best friend if she could run me over to our local third-party AT&amp;amp;T store so I could get this sorted. Three hours there, I had a new SIM card and all was okay. Service seemed more spotty than usual at first, but I chalked that up to being due to the utter pain that it was to move my number over to a new SIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just over a month later, in early October, it broke &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, I’m frustrated, but I had one of my best friends staying with me at the time. So, I just decided to move my SIM card over to another phone I had around to see if that fixed it: it did. Once he left after a really relaxing and fun week, I attempted to call AT&amp;amp;T for the fourth time with my second phone and get told it’s a 6 hour wait. I’m fuming at this point, and in my head I’m thinking “I’m calling you at 2pm on a Sunday, and &lt;em&gt;conveniently&lt;/em&gt; the wait to speak to one of your representatives is up until closing?” I call again, this time it’s an 8-hour wait. I gave up after 10 minutes on hold (of which I had hoped someone would just &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; so I didn’t have to sit in a queue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling out of options, I decided to post about it on social media as a last resort. I don’t like doing that because I’m a pretty well-known guy in the tech world, and I don’t like feeling as if I may “abuse” my reputation in some way. (I don’t deserve special treatment.) But, I got a direct message from someone on the AT&amp;amp;T Social Media team directly asking me to reach out. The next day, I had a working phone again. I asked some questions regarding why this happened and basically got the runaround again. Sounds like they very quickly figured out who I was… but I’m not here to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now November 22nd, 2022, as I write this to Blo(n)g(er), and I’ve been without phone service for around a week and a half. I’ve been able to use an iPhone (again) to bypass the issues. My conclusion, after several days of research, is this: the transition to 5G on AT&amp;amp;T’s network has been a nightmare. AT&amp;amp;T has also outright refused to replace or otherwise help folks with phones. And to others who may be experiencing similar issues (specifically moving from 4G LTE to 5G), and are now considering other options, you’re not alone. My mom and several friends of mine have reported similar issues, so I know it’s not isolated. (The fact that it isn’t isolated is the particularly scary part.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering how many times I’ve had to go without service, I’m now in the same boat feeling the same way as many others: &lt;em&gt;I’m done with AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/em&gt;. Which is unfortunate, because their coverage (when it works) works &lt;em&gt;amazingly&lt;/em&gt; well. But, I can’t keep something that isn’t going to be work reliably 24/7. With that said, I was able to order a free SIM kit from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmobile.com&quot;&gt;US Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, who came highly recommended in almost every listicle and social media post I could find. They go through either the Verizon or T-Mobile networks for their coverage. Since Verizon is the second largest around here (with AT&amp;amp;T being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; largest), I’m opting to go with that SIM card (Warp 5G) for service on the Unlimited Premium plan. (I’ll make a separate post about why I went with Unlimited Premium as the plan sometime down the road…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not ideal, I haven’t always had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; luck with Verizon or T-Mobile, but Verizon has done a lot of work expanding on their network where I live… and they’re at least reliable. Oh, and if all else fails: Wi-Fi Calling exists. And at this point, I’ll consider all of that a win at this point. (I’ll report back on US Mobile once I’ve had enough time to put it through the paces… Fingers crossed.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Blo(n)g(er)</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/welcome-to-blonger/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Blo(n)g(er)" /><published>2022-11-21T16:33:11-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-21T16:33:11-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-11-21-welcome-to-blonger.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/welcome-to-blonger/">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Blo(n)g(er).
