For those who don‚Äôt know, Tweetbot has been the primary way I‚Äôve accessed and used Twitter since December 2019 ‚Äì and has been an indispensible tool for staying connected to my friends and for networking with my fellow journalists. It has also been a way to avoid the changes Elon Musk (from henceforth to be referred to in this post, and any future posts as ‚ÄúSpace Karen‚Äù) has made to the Twitter website as a whole that have made it basically impossible to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn‚Äôt breaking news: the stock Twitter app has always been poorly designed, and Musk‚Äôs changes have only made it worse (and haven‚Äôt really been well-received, either). &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1606055187348688896&quot;&gt;View counts&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1612966288300572672&quot;&gt;for you/following tab change&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1612966849200754688&quot;&gt;no way to set a default view&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23506335/twitter-blue-verified-checkmarks-return-impersonation&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1596053664338440192&quot;&gt;verification badge changes&lt;/a&gt;, etc. (Twitter Blue, in fact, can very easily be described as a cash grab, considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/01/10/twitters-debt-and-value-have-plunged-painfully-since-elon-musk-takeover-sources/&quot;&gt;how much debt the company has&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/twitter-reportedly-hasnt-paid-rent-on-its-office-spaces-for-weeks.html&quot;&gt;refusal to pay rent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220414103558/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-14/elon-musk-launches-43-billion-hostile-takeover-of-twitter&quot;&gt;how much Space Karen bought it for&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Space Karen, if this ousting of clients was in fact intentional, he may have just killed a massive part of his newfound business by moving in this direction. Several companies use third-party apps to handle customer service and manage their social media presences, and word on the street is those are next. And that would suck even more for Space Karen. But, as he has done through every step of his takeover, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/twitters-latest-feature-is-how-you-know-elon-musk-is-in-over-his-head-its-cautionary-tale-every-business-needs-to-hear.html&quot;&gt;repeatedly chosen to learn the hard way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences won‚Äôt be felt by him for a while, but they will be felt eventually. I can assure you of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw folks ask if this was a way for him to serve more ads. But the truth is, there‚Äôs only a small percentage of &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; who use third-party clients. And the API does more than simply power those. Space Karen doing this actually puts more of a strain on his business, because API access for a large number of requests to certain endpoints are &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, they‚Äôre making his business money. And that‚Äôs not even to mention the businesses who use tools like Sprinklr or Sprout Social to manage their social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(An interesting note to add here in the break: The people I met who also used third-party clients like Quinn Nelson of Snazzy Labs literally &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1456738492105461764&quot;&gt;could not see their own mentions without doing so&lt;/a&gt;. And I‚Äôm one of those people, too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest with you all, I‚Äôve been watching this whole thing unfold for a while now, and I think this might be the lullaby for Twitter. While the users using these clients were very little in size, in the grand scheme of things, it will represent a massive shift. The clients were being built by companies, and naturally, the users who have been ousted by using an app they enjoy from a company they enjoy will move on to support them in their other endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the brilliant minds behind Tweetbot ‚Äì &lt;a href=&quot;https://tapbots.com&quot;&gt;Tapbots&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì are making a new client for Mastodon called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tapbots.com/ivory/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that is easily described as Tweetbot: &lt;em&gt;Mastodon Edition&lt;/em&gt;. (It‚Äôs quite good and getting even better with each build!) I‚Äôve already seen &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of support going towards Tapbots, and I can confidentally say a decent amount of people will follow them off Twitter to go support it.  And I bet even folks who didn‚Äôt use Tweetbot, but feel bad for the position Space Karen has thrown these developers into, will go subscribe to Ivory or another app to support Tapbots or whoever else is affected, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of communication on this change has, understandably, made developers (affected or not) feel like they aren‚Äôt respected by Twitter. Myself included, as I have an application called Watchtower (from back when I was developing that as a fork of the TwidereX codebase), that is now effectively bricked. It shows as ‚ÄúSuspended‚Äù in the dashboard, with a statement claiming it has violated some rules with an email having been sent to me with more info. (Readers, this email has not shown up, and I‚Äôm not sure if others have gotten an email either.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And frankly, fellow developers, I think this move ‚Äì the ‚Äúpull the plug and act like nothing happened‚Äù strategy ‚Äì demonstrates just how little we are respected by Elon and the remaining Twitter Dev team. But you‚Äôre welcome to your own opinions and speculation here, of course‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, Space Karen has inadvertently created a second Twitter exodus. This time, both all the people who hate the stock app that has been given massive, mostly unwanted updates he has touted as ‚Äúthe best thing since sliced bread,‚Äù and the people who want to support the businesses he damaged by shutting down API access to the clients‚Ä¶ you know, just the ones that were giving Twitter the little amount of life it had left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for where I stand? Well, the eagle-eyed among you have gotten in touch to ask me why my account is private, and I figured I‚Äôd address that here. When the situation began Thursday night, I privated my account and uninstalled the app from my phone. At least for now, I will be honouring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-think-i-am-done-with-twitter-for-now/&quot;&gt;what I‚Äôd said I‚Äôd do a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and am stepping back from Twitter. I might unprivate my account once I publish this blog post to Blo(n)g(er), just so anyone who follows a link can actually see what‚Äôs going on. I may come back, I may not, so it‚Äôs not goodbye: it‚Äôs just see you later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of dunking on Space Karen with everyone else, as easy as it is to do (yay, herd mentality!), I will be focusing my efforts on making the open web better for everyone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party/@slade&quot;&gt;Mastodon/the fediverse&lt;/a&gt; will be my new, primary home for the foreseeable future. I run my own instance of that and it‚Äôs been a source of joy for me, exploring a technology that‚Äôs relatively new in the grand scheme of the internet. I‚Äôd like to continue fueling joy instead of anxiety and doomscrolling; and hopefully someday, if at all possible, heal my relationship with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who‚Äôd like to come with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon/the fediverse: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party/@slade&quot;&gt;@slade@pope.party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elsewhere: &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/sladewatkins&quot;&gt;Linktree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Til then‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì Slade
P.S. &lt;em&gt;Rest in peace, Twitter of yore.

&lt;p&gt;I admit, I was skeptical at first when all the claims of its security first came out, but semi-recent developments have PROVEN that  it is a privacy and security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge others to completely delete their accounts and remove the app from their phones as soon as possible. It is not safe to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the next chapter, somewhere that isn‚Äôt a risk to privacy, security, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Every year in the ‚Äò20s has had its own ‚Äúyear of‚Äù theme‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020&lt;/strong&gt;: Year of The Pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt;: Year of The Pandemic: Season Two, Electric Boogaloo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt;: Year of The Pandemic: Season Three, now with Absolute Chaos mixed in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what will 2023 bring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I hope it brings that special someone closer to me. I hope it brings happiness and prosperity to myself, and especially the people around me. I hope it brings more quality time with family and friends, most of whom I haven‚Äôt seen since before the pandemic began. And I hope it brings success: for every project I work on and release this coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 wasn‚Äôt easy by any means. There‚Äôs a lot of moving parts that made it so overwhelming and insane. But it‚Äôs over now ‚Äî 2023 has the opportunity to be (and will be) different. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 2023 will the &lt;strong&gt;year of love, happiness, success, and change.&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôm calling it now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">RSS is great, now stop truncating your feeds</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/rss-is-great-now-stop-truncating-your-feeds/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="RSS is great, now stop truncating your feeds" /><published>2022-12-27T12:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-27T12:30:00-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-12-27-rss-is-great-now-stop-truncating-your-feeds.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/rss-is-great-now-stop-truncating-your-feeds/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rssboard.org/rss-specification&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; (which is known fully as ‚ÄúReally Simple Syndication‚Äù) has been around for &lt;em&gt;a long time&lt;/em&gt;. It‚Äôs a simple way to consume and enjoy content from all across the web, and many website owners (usually those with news sites or blogs) include a version of their website using the RSS standard for people who get their news from an RSS reader app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that‚Äôs not the only thing RSS can do: it was used as the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-an-svg-file&quot;&gt;.svg&lt;/a&gt;, and Tom Scott &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomscott.com/updates.xml&quot;&gt;uses it to promote his videos&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve noticed a serious problem with the standard, especially as I‚Äôve started testing Reeder for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac (which uses RSS feeds to fetch content from across the web)‚Ä¶. And that is that &lt;strong&gt;most RSS feeds are &lt;em&gt;almost always&lt;/em&gt; truncated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truncated means that the post available in the RSS feed is shortened significantly ‚Äî directing users to their website to read the feed update instead of the RSS reader app they‚Äôre currently in. The reason why a website owner might do this is obvious ‚Äî targeted, privacy-unfriendly ads are obviously a huge way for site owners to make a boat load of money &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî and RSS presents an obvious roadblock to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because RSS was designed to be ‚Äúprivate‚Äù in the sense that it doesn‚Äôt grab in-line ads, doesn‚Äôt support the tracking of visit time or views, and ‚Äî depending on the site owner ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt always load in-line images either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are some ways around this of course, though it would cost site owners a lot of money if they‚Äôre on some sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor/&quot;&gt;pay-per-click/view plan with their client&lt;/a&gt;. A couple examples I can think of include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sponsored excerpts (insert these into posts); or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sponsored posts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/sponsored/&quot;&gt;similar to how MacStories does it&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in the open, but private web. I believe every site should be an interconnected web of information and utility, not plastered banner ads and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ark_shitposts/status/1606043352251527168&quot;&gt;overwhelming interfaces that change weekly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means shifting away from proprietary, forced interfaces and finding new ways to adapt. You can see this in action with &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; and how a mass amount of users are &lt;a href=&quot;https://metro.co.uk/2022/12/26/mastadon-gains-millions-of-new-users-as-twitter-exodus-continues-17997380/&quot;&gt;migrating from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon, a piece of open-source software&lt;/a&gt; built on said standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, stop truncating your RSS feeds. Open up the floodgates and let folks choose how they want to consume your content. (By the way: the RSS feed for my site is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sladewatkins.com/feed.xml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">I think I‚Äôm done with Twitter, for now.</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-think-i-am-done-with-twitter-for-now/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I think I&apos;m done with Twitter, for now." /><published>2022-12-22T19:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-22T19:45:00-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-12-22-i-think-i-am-done-with-twitter-for-now.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-think-i-am-done-with-twitter-for-now/">&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I saw this day coming from a mile away. But I didn‚Äôt think it happen this soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has been home to my growth and success building an audience for roughly a year and a half now (consistently). I‚Äôve been lurking on the site since 2015, and have had many accounts amassing thousands of followers combined. But with the uncertainty under what can only be described as Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù ownership of the service, I‚Äôve found myself questioning whether or not to stay a ‚Äúdaily active user.‚Äù For example, the most recent changes have begun to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremydstanley/status/1606055558385225744&quot;&gt;break&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1606055187348688896&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; the service drastically (some changes in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evacide/status/1605028948596781056&quot;&gt;especially affect accessibility&lt;/a&gt;), and has even led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twittercommunity.com/t/twitter-v2-api-missing-source-field-again/181895/1&quot;&gt;serious neglect of the API lately&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest with you all, I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I‚Äôm going to be stepping away. Forever? No, heavens no. But for now, yes! My notifications are off, my DMs are closed &lt;em&gt;to the public&lt;/em&gt;, and I‚Äôm moving on from everyday activity for right this second. This could change in a week, a month, maybe a year, but &lt;strong&gt;I really need the break.&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôll be arbitrarily putting myself on a ‚ÄúTwitter diet‚Äù of just 20 minutes per day, should I choose to check it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what will I actually be posting? Well, for transparency, this is what I‚Äôve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The highlights (stories I‚Äôm putting out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kakarikoherald.com&quot;&gt;Kakariko Herald&lt;/a&gt;, life updates, pet pics, that sort of thing.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other announcements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replies to friends and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, none of these will be posted every day. Just every couple days or so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, I‚Äôm getting a break from the chaos and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-doomscrolling&quot;&gt;doomscrolling&lt;/a&gt;. Every five minutes it‚Äôs something new. It‚Äôs making me unhappy and that needs to change, so I can put my heart into some of the things I actually care about (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.rverse.club/@rverse&quot;&gt;rverse for Wii U&lt;/a&gt;, one of the things I want to launch with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tigstahh.com&quot;&gt;Tigstahh&lt;/a&gt; or even our joint project Kakariko Herald). Doomscrolling isn‚Äôt helping me in the slightest. It stops today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you‚Äôd like to get &lt;em&gt;super frequent&lt;/em&gt; updates from me instead of &lt;em&gt;what I‚Äôve laid out above&lt;/em&gt;, I‚Äôm on &lt;a href=&quot;https://slade.link/links&quot;&gt;several other platforms&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party/@slade&quot;&gt;@slade@pope.party&lt;/a&gt; on your favourite fediverse interface (Mastodon, Misskey, etc.) If you‚Äôre feeling old school, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; is always an option and is something I use very frequently! But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì whatever‚Äôs super important, you‚Äôll see it on the bird too. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love üíô and Happy Holidays,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, my friends and I are now hosting &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party&quot;&gt;our own instance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, which has already begun communicating with the rest of the fediverse. I am, of course, the admin as becomes custom with anything that requires work to make happen. (&lt;em&gt;Sigh.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name, &lt;strong&gt;pope.party&lt;/strong&gt;, is actually part of an &lt;em&gt;inside joke&lt;/em&gt; I had with my friends. To explain that for you: one of my closest friends, Colin, frequently uses a Google Translate language pack within Minecraft that changes the ‚Äúlava plops‚Äù subtitle to ‚Äúbenefits of the pope‚Äù ‚Ä¶and thus, the name was born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Twitter‚Äôs acquisition by Elon Musk, and the clear indication that Big Tech was only going to get bigger, I previously announced via social media that I‚Äôd commit to using open-source software and technologies on my devices going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reigns true with me taking a moment to reiterate the announcement, as well as detail the specifics of what I‚Äôve changed thus far (as of November 4, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, here was my full statement on it‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm making a commitment to [heavily] use open-source software in my workflow starting in 2023. Until that time, I will slowly phase out [most] proprietary software on my systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The only exception will be if it‚Äôs needed for work. Otherwise, an open-source alternative will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sick of enabling corporate overlords and billionaires, and will not allow them to exert control over how I operate on a day-to-day. This mission has already begun with my switch back to Linux, this time using the Ubuntu-based Pop!_OS*.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where I am able, I will give back to these open-source projects monetarily, time-wise (helping with PRs, issues, development), or both. I am a firm believer in open-source: it is the future. Life‚Äôs better when we all work together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve changed so far‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will no longer use Windows unless it is absolutely required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I use Linux for computing devices, Android on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve switched from Adobe Creative Cloud to DaVinci Resolve and GIMP on my primary system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to update this article as I continue changing my workflow over to open source alternatives. I expect to be fully switched over to mostly open-source projects by February 6, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to hit me up and ask questions about it! I usually hang out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pope.party/@slade&quot;&gt;Mastodon (@slade@pope.party)&lt;/a&gt;, but I can also be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.slade.link&quot;&gt;everywhere else&lt;/a&gt; too (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sladewatkins.com/contact/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">I‚Äôm an indecisive mess</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-am-an-indecisive-mess/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I&apos;m an indecisive mess" /><published>2022-12-03T00:58:36-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-03T00:58:36-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-12-03-i-am-an-indecisive-mess.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/i-am-an-indecisive-mess/">&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm an indecisive mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know what type of phone I want to use ‚Äì dumb phone, smart phone, Android phone, iOS phone ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know what operating system I want to use. I‚Äôve used probably every type of device, and while I do have preferences, I almost never stick with anything for more than a couple weeks. That annoys people, I get it, but I like to try everything. And sometimes I find new things that fit into the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing annoys my brain too. I feel conflicted about &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. That‚Äôs not great for me, because all of a sudden ‚Äì in the middle of the day ‚Äì I‚Äôll just decide to switch a SIM card to a different phone or reinstall the OS on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it fun? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it, at the same exact time, stressful? Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I keep doing it? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">And now, a word from our sponsor</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="And now, a word from our sponsor" /><published>2022-11-30T21:20:57-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-30T21:20:57-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-11-30-and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/and-now-a-word-from-our-sponsor/">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got feelings about accepting sponsorships. And since it‚Äôs the holiday season, I wanted to share how I determine whether or not to take a sponsorship, or join an affiliate program, as those emails are starting to hit my inbox now‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your due diligence.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot stress this one enough: A company is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/itsechomusic_/status/1572047690069843968&quot;&gt;not all they seem to be&lt;/a&gt;, so do your research and make an informed decision based on the information you find. &lt;em&gt;Google, review sites, and similar are your best friends: use them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your worth.&lt;/strong&gt; If a company won‚Äôt at least negotiate (read: compromise) for a fair price, it‚Äôs best to walk away. I‚Äôve done it many times that I‚Äôve lost count. &lt;em&gt;If only you knew how much I‚Äôve left on the table‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it seems sketchy, it probably is.&lt;/strong&gt; Trust your gut. If it seems off in any way, don‚Äôt accept it. No, really.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair, flat rates only.&lt;/strong&gt; Don‚Äôt do anything that relies on clicks or views for payment. That‚Äôs not an ad, that‚Äôs an affiliate scheme. Those are basically scams in 2022‚Ä¶ run away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, none of that is to say you &lt;em&gt;can‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; join an affiliate program. But you shouldn‚Äôt be asked in the guise of ‚Äúthis is a sponsorship.‚Äù In my opinion, if you‚Äôre joining an affiliate program, it‚Äôs something &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; decide and aren‚Äôt coerced into, something &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; believe in and not told to believe in. Working like this since 2019 has only given me the strength to take on sponsorships, or join the affiliate programs of things I care about. Everyone deserves that freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post helps someone. That‚Äôs the idea. Let me know if you have any questions, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">The AT&amp;amp;T Saga</title><link href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/the-att-saga/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The AT&amp;T Saga" /><published>2022-11-22T23:22:44-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T23:22:44-05:00</updated><id>repo://posts.collection/_posts/2022-11-22-the-att-saga.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/the-att-saga/">&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I should explain &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1594799892148662272&quot;&gt;what on Earth happened&lt;/a&gt; to make me finally switch from the carrier that I‚Äôve defended endlessly for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; now. &lt;strong&gt;Because my recommendations to family and friends regarding cell phone services are about to change because of the experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For context&lt;/strong&gt;: Prior to when the story begins, I had multiple issues where my phone(s) would randomly stop detecting the AT&amp;amp;T network, and I would need to call to get my SIM provisioned. That happened three separate times. Keep this in mind as you read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July this past year (2022), I got a new phone that had 5G capabilities. I didn‚Äôt have a phone plan that could use it ‚Äì I was grandfathered in ‚Äì nor did I have a 5G-capable SIM card anyways, so I just decided to forgo it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may‚Äôve been a mistake, as around a week later, my SIM card died. I immediately contacted AT&amp;amp;T Support for assistance wherein they essentially told me if I did not upgrade my &lt;em&gt;grandfathered&lt;/em&gt; phone plan, they would not issue a SIM. In other words‚Ä¶ I got the run-around: how lovely! Frustrated, I disconnected with them and went to go speak with my father. My parents upgraded my phone plan to the highest one, the one with 5G, and after a couple minutes ‚Äì it was fine! ‚Ä¶For a little more than 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it‚Äôs August, and I‚Äôve completely lost service again. At this point, I‚Äôve been without it I asked my best friend if she could run me over to our local third-party AT&amp;amp;T store so I could get this sorted. Three hours there, I had a new SIM card and all was okay. Service seemed more spotty than usual at first, but I chalked that up to being due to the utter pain that it was to move my number over to a new SIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just over a month later, in early October, it broke &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, I‚Äôm frustrated, but I had one of my best friends staying with me at the time. So, I just decided to move my SIM card over to another phone I had around to see if that fixed it: it did. Once he left after a really relaxing and fun week, I attempted to call AT&amp;amp;T for the fourth time with my second phone and get told it‚Äôs a 6 hour wait. I‚Äôm fuming at this point, and in my head I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling you at 2pm on a Sunday, and &lt;em&gt;conveniently&lt;/em&gt; the wait to speak to one of your representatives is up until closing?‚Äù I call again, this time it‚Äôs an 8-hour wait. I gave up after 10 minutes on hold (of which I had hoped someone would just &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; so I didn‚Äôt have to sit in a queue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling out of options, I decided to post about it on social media as a last resort. I don‚Äôt like doing that because I‚Äôm a pretty well-known guy in the tech world, and I don‚Äôt like feeling as if I may ‚Äúabuse‚Äù my reputation in some way. (I don‚Äôt deserve special treatment.) But, I got a direct message from someone on the AT&amp;amp;T Social Media team directly asking me to reach out. The next day, I had a working phone again. I asked some questions regarding why this happened and basically got the runaround again. Sounds like they very quickly figured out who I was‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not here to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs now November 22nd, 2022, as I write this to Blo(n)g(er), and I‚Äôve been without phone service for around a week and a half. I‚Äôve been able to use an iPhone (again) to bypass the issues. My conclusion, after several days of research, is this: the transition to 5G on AT&amp;amp;T‚Äôs network has been a nightmare. AT&amp;amp;T has also outright refused to replace or otherwise help folks with phones. And to others who may be experiencing similar issues (specifically moving from 4G LTE to 5G), and are now considering other options, you‚Äôre not alone. My mom and several friends of mine have reported similar issues, so I know it‚Äôs not isolated. (The fact that it isn‚Äôt isolated is the particularly scary part.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering how many times I‚Äôve had to go without service, I‚Äôm now in the same boat feeling the same way as many others: &lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm done with AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/em&gt;. Which is unfortunate, because their coverage (when it works) works &lt;em&gt;amazingly&lt;/em&gt; well. But, I can‚Äôt keep something that isn‚Äôt going to be work reliably 24/7. With that said, I was able to order a free SIM kit from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmobile.com&quot;&gt;US Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, who came highly recommended in almost every listicle and social media post I could find. They go through either the Verizon or T-Mobile networks for their coverage. Since Verizon is the second largest around here (with AT&amp;amp;T being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; largest), I‚Äôm opting to go with that SIM card (Warp 5G) for service on the Unlimited Premium plan. (I‚Äôll make a separate post about why I went with Unlimited Premium as the plan sometime down the road‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not ideal, I haven‚Äôt always had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; luck with Verizon or T-Mobile, but Verizon has done a lot of work expanding on their network where I live‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôre at least reliable. Oh, and if all else fails: Wi-Fi Calling exists. And at this point, I‚Äôll consider all of that a win at this point. (I‚Äôll report back on US Mobile once I‚Äôve had enough time to put it through the paces‚Ä¶ Fingers crossed.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Slade Rice Watkins</name></author></entry></feed>
