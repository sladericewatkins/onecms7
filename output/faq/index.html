      <h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="what-operating-system-do-you-prefer-most">What operating system do you prefer most?</h2>
<p>macOS.</p>

<h2 id="is-dear-nintendo-still-being-maintained">Is ‘Dear Nintendo’ still being maintained?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is still available at <a href="https://dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com">dearnintendo.sladewatkins.com</a>. Folks can sign the open letter until March 2023, at which point, it will be <a href="https://vault.sladewatkins.com">sent to the vault</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-true-that-you-spoke-to-new-york-state-lawmakers-in-2021">Is it true that you spoke to New York State lawmakers in 2021?</h2>
<p>As part of Lobby Day, I spoke to several lawmakers in New York State, including <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/daphne-jordan">my senator</a>, about my experience in BOCES programs over the years. Part of that included advocating for the continuation of funding for my former school.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-true-you-work-with-insert-name-here">Is it true you work with (insert name here)?</h2>
<p>The only affiliation I publicly have is with the <a href="https://www.wallymer.com">Wallymer group</a>. My friends and I work on projects under that name with help and guidance from some of our mentors.</p>

<h2 id="what-phone-do-you-daily-drive">What phone do you daily drive?</h2>
<p>I daily drive both an iPhone SE (2nd generation) <em>and</em> Google Pixel 6, both connected to <a href="https://www.usmobile.com">US Mobile</a> (Verizon). I switch which one is in “lead” (read: “has my personal SIM card in it”) pretty frequently. It’s a bad habit, I know… but hey, it is what it is.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-up-to-nowadays">What are you up to nowadays?</h2>
<p>Well, I work on <a href="https://www.kakarikoherald.com">Kakariko Herald</a> full-time, which I juggle with some other secret projects! I love what I do and wouldn’t change it for the world. If you’d like to support me, you can find me over on KH!</p>
