      <h1>Statement Regarding Twitter Blue Subcription<br/>
<span class="byline">Written by Slade Rice Watkins &bull; Published on Mar 28th, 2023</span>
</h1>

<p>I’ve been getting harassed, so it’s time to address this, even though I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1628929140924592130">made</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1639107780299616256">many</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1639346961764478976">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1640463096119693312">posts</a> about it: yes, for whatever reason I am verified as a subscriber to Twitter Blue. I’d like to <a href="https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1640565300503379971">set the record straight, WITH SCREENSHOTS</a> so I can stop enduring the harassment and blocks from fellow writers (I won’t name names, that’s not my thing.)</p>

<h2 id="are-you-actually-a-subscriber-to-twitter-blue">Are you actually a subscriber to Twitter Blue?</h2>
<p><strong>ABSOLUTELY NOT</strong>, I do not give <a href="https://www.sladewatkins.com/blonger/the-twitter-saga-episode-uh-i-have-lost-count/">“Space Karen”</a> any money. I cancelled my sub in December and the badge has stuck since for whatever reason.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/sladericewatkins/image/upload/c_scale,w_317/v1682743903/blog_attachments/TcKF2PS_nkwkue.png" alt="My Twitter account page, with the verified badge selected that states &quot;This account is verified because it's subscribed to Twitter Blue.&quot; It is very much not subscribed to Twitter Blue." /><br />

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/sladericewatkins/image/upload/c_scale,w_302/v1682743884/blog_attachments/xPGLtay_mlsgcu.jpg" alt="The subscriptions tab within the App Store on my phone that clearly shows that I haven't been subscribed to Twitter Blue since it expired on January 9th, 2023. Below that it says I can Renew for $11.00/month." /></p>

<h2 id="so-then-why-does-it-say-youre-subscribed">So then why does it say you’re subscribed?</h2>
<p>I suspect it is a bug, and I can’t do anything about it. Seriously! I do not work for Twitter, nor will I ever work at Twitter (or under Space Karen for that matter, you literally couldn’t pay me enough), and I do not have the ability to fix an issue they created by halphazardly “bodging” things together in production with very little testing.</p>

<h2 id="why-were-you-subscribed-then-dont-you-hate-space-karen">Why were you subscribed then? Don’t you hate Space Karen?</h2>
<p>I do, yes! The context here is that I was subscribed via a contractor for less than 2 months specifically for research which has long since been contributed &amp; I no longer had no use for it so I had it cancelled because <a href="https://twitter.com/sladewatkins/status/1600694737727500288">it was (and is) ridiculous</a>. That’s as much as I’m legally allowed to say due to a non-disclosure agreement. I never gave Twitter any money directly and I never will. Period. End of story.</p>

<h2 id="im-being-ethical">I’m being ethical</h2>
<p>Please know that I adhere to the <a href="https://www.spj.org/pdf/spj-code-of-ethics.pdf">SPJ Code of Ethics</a> <em>to a tee</em> when contributing to research, reporting, etc. I have, and will continue to admit, when I am wrong about something and immediately issue corrections. Period.</p>

<p>I also apply my own “code of ethics” when working on social media. “Paying to play, netting myself a badge and extra features, implies endorsement of a particular platform or service, and is a line I will not cross. <em>I must do everything I can to be impartial</em>.</p>

<p>Rest assured that my integrity as a researcher and writer/journalist is a million times more important to me than a social media website.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />
– Slade</p>
